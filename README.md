# Orbis SDK for React Native
By using the Orbis SDK for React Native, developers can build their own decentralized social mobile apps or features for iOS or Android.

## Documentation
Our full documentation is available at https://orbis.club/developers

## Polyfills
For the Ceramic package to work well you need to use some polyfills, you can integrate our by adding this line in App.js

`import '@orbisclub/orbis-sdk-react-native/utils/polyfills_light_crypto';`

## Why you should build on Orbis
By being built on top of Ceramic, Orbis offers many advantages to developers interested in building decentralized social applications:

- No transaction fees
- Users donâ€™t have to sign a message for each action they take
- Write times are very fast which offers a user experience similar to web2
- Every piece of content shared on Orbis is decentralized on the Ceramic network and anyone can access it
- There is a full composability between apps built on the Orbis ecosystem
- (Coming soon) Multichain: Users can join Orbis using additional chains such as Cosmos or Solana and interact together in the same digital space

## Use cases
Here are some examples of applications that could be built on top of Orbis:

- Full social apps like [orbis.club](https://orbis.club)
- Decentralized & encrypted messaging system
- Fully customizable & embedded group chat servers
- Decentralized Discourse governance forums
- Decentralized support system (similar to Intercom)
- Decentralized version of Slack
- Decentralized commenting features
- And many other things...
